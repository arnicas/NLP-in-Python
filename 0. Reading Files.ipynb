He did not trouble\\r\\nhimself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to\\r\\nthe theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him\\r\\nfor displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of\\r\\nthe day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say,\\r\\n\"he is sitting in council,\" it was always said of him, \"The Emperor is\\r\\nsitting in his wardrobe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers\\r\\narrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves\\r\\nweavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to\\r\\nweave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the\\r\\nclothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of\\r\\nremaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or\\r\\nwho was extraordinarily simple in character.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!\" thought the Emperor. \"Had I\\r\\nsuch a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit\\r\\nfor their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the\\r\\nfoolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately.\" And he caused\\r\\nlarge sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they\\r\\nmight begin their work directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very\\r\\nbusily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the\\r\\nmost delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own\\r\\nknapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms\\r\\nuntil late at night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,\"\\r\\nsaid the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was,\\r\\nhowever, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or\\r\\none unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be\\r\\nsure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he\\r\\nwould prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the\\r\\nweavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All\\r\\nthe people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the\\r\\ncloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how\\r\\nignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,\" said the Emperor\\r\\nat last, after some deliberation, \"he will be best able to see how the\\r\\ncloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable\\r\\nfor his office than he is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were\\r\\nworking with all their might, at their empty looms. \"What can be the\\r\\nmeaning of this?\" thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. \"I\\r\\ncannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.\" However, he did\\r\\nnot express his thoughts aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come\\r\\nnearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased\\r\\nhim, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time\\r\\npointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked,\\r\\nhe could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason,\\r\\nviz: there was nothing there. \"What!\" thought he again. \"Is it possible\\r\\nthat I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must\\r\\nknow it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No,\\r\\nthat must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see\\r\\nthe stuff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Sir Minister!\" said one of the knaves, still pretending to work.\\r\\n\"You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it is excellent!\" replied the old minister, looking at the loom\\r\\nthrough his spectacles. \"This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell\\r\\nthe Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall be much obliged to you,\" said the impostors, and then they\\r\\nnamed the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended\\r\\nstuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order\\r\\nthat he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for\\r\\nmore silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what\\r\\nthey had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their\\r\\nknapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as\\r\\nbefore at their empty looms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men\\r\\nwere getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be\\r\\nready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister;\\r\\nhe surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the\\r\\nempty frames.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the\\r\\nminister?\" asked the impostors of the Emperor\\'s second ambassador; at\\r\\nthe same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the\\r\\ndesign and colors which were not there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly am not stupid!\" thought the messenger. \"It must be, that I\\r\\nam not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no\\r\\none shall know anything about it.\" And accordingly he praised the stuff\\r\\nhe could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors\\r\\nand patterns. \"Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,\" said he to his\\r\\nsovereign when he returned, \"the cloth which the weavers are preparing\\r\\nis extraordinarily magnificent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had\\r\\nordered to be woven at his own expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while\\r\\nit was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of\\r\\nthe court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired\\r\\nthe cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were\\r\\naware of the Emperor\\'s approach, went on working more diligently than\\r\\never; although they still did not pass a single thread through the\\r\\nlooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is not the work absolutely magnificent?\" said the two officers of the\\r\\ncrown, already mentioned. \"If your Majesty will only be pleased to look\\r\\nat it! What a splendid design! What glorious colors!\" and at the same\\r\\ntime they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone\\r\\nelse could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How is this?\" said the Emperor to himself. \"I can see nothing! This\\r\\nis indeed a terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an\\r\\nEmperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen--Oh! the cloth\\r\\nis charming,\" said he, aloud. \"It has my complete approbation.\" And he\\r\\nsmiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no\\r\\naccount would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of\\r\\nhis court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes,\\r\\nhoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more\\r\\nthan the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, \"Oh, how beautiful!\"\\r\\nand advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid\\r\\nmaterial, for the approaching procession. \"Magnificent! Charming!\\r\\nExcellent!\" resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The\\r\\nEmperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors\\r\\nwith the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their\\r\\nbutton-holes, and the title of \"Gentlemen Weavers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the\\r\\nprocession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that\\r\\neveryone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor\\'s new\\r\\nsuit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with\\r\\ntheir scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them.\\r\\n\"See!\" cried they, at last. \"The Emperor\\'s new clothes are ready!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the\\r\\nweavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding\\r\\nsomething up, saying, \"Here are your Majesty\\'s trousers! Here is the\\r\\nscarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb;\\r\\none might fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that,\\r\\nhowever, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes indeed!\" said all the courtiers, although not one of them could see\\r\\nanything of this exquisite manufacture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your\\r\\nclothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to\\r\\narray him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side,\\r\\nbefore the looking glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they\\r\\nfit!\" everyone cried out. \"What a design! What colors! These are indeed\\r\\nroyal robes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession,\\r\\nis waiting,\" announced the chief master of the ceremonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite ready,\" answered the Emperor. \"Do my new clothes fit well?\"\\r\\nasked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order\\r\\nthat he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty\\'s train felt\\r\\nabout on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle;\\r\\nand pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means\\r\\nbetray anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their office.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the\\r\\nprocession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people\\r\\nstanding by, and those at the windows, cried out, \"Oh! How beautiful\\r\\nare our Emperor\\'s new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to\\r\\nthe mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!\" in short, no one would\\r\\nallow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in\\r\\ndoing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit\\r\\nfor his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor\\'s various suits, had ever\\r\\nmade so great an impression, as these invisible ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the Emperor has nothing at all on!\" said a little child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen to the voice of innocence!\" exclaimed his father; and what the\\r\\nchild had said was whispered from one to another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he has nothing at all on!\" at last cried out all the people.\\r\\nThe Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he\\r\\nthought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber\\r\\ntook greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in\\r\\nreality, there was no train to hold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
