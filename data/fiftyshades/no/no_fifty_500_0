"CHAPTER ONE I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror. Damn my hair * it just won * t behave , and damn Katherine Kavanagh for being ill and subjecting me to this ordeal. I should be studying for my final exams , which are next week , yet here I am trying to brush my hair into submission. I must not sleep with it wet. I must not sleep with it wet. Reciting this mantra several times , I attempt , once more , to bring it under control with the brush. I roll my eyes in exasperation and gaze at the pale , brown-haired girl with blue eyes too big for her face staring back at me , and give up.

Here are the questions and my digital recorder. Just press record here.
