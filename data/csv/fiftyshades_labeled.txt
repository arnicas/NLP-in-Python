I am now naked , staring at myself , and he * s kneeling behind me. He kisses and then softly bites my behind , making me gasp. He stands and stares at me once more in the mirror.

Get up. * He stoops down and kisses me again . * I * ve brought you a drink. I * ll be downstairs. Don * t go back to sleep , or you * ll be in trouble , * he threatens , but his tone is mild. He kisses me briefly and exits , leaving me blinking sleep from my eyes in the cool , stark room . I * m refreshed but suddenly nervous. Holy cow , I am meeting his folks ! He * s just worked me over with a riding crop and trussed me up using a cable tie which I sold him , for heaven * s sake * and I * m going to meet his parents. It will be Kate * s first time meeting them , too * at least she * ll be there for support. I roll my shoulders. They * re stiff. His demands for a personal trainer don * t seem so outlandish now. In fact , it * s mandatory if I am to have any hope of keeping up with him . I climb slowly out of bed and note that my dress is hanging outside the wardrobe and my bra is on the chair. Where are my panties ? I check beneath the chair. Nothing. Then I remember * he squirreled"	maybe

Something you can * t do ? * I grin at him , and he grins back . * No , hopeless joke teller. * He looks so proud of himself that I start to giggle . * I * m a hopeless joke teller , too. * * That is such a lovely sound , * he murmurs , and he leans forward and kisses me . * And you are hiding something , Anastasia. I may have to torture it out of you. * CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX I wake with a jolt. I think I * ve just fallen down some stairs in a dream , and I bolt upright , momentarily disoriented. It is dark , and I * m in Christian * s bed alone. Something has woken me , some nagging thought. I glance over at the alarm clock on his bedside. It is five in the morning , but I feel rested. Why is that ? Oh * it * s the time difference * it would be eight a.m. in Georgia. Holy crap * I need to take my pill. I clamber out of bed , grateful for whatever it is that has woken me. I can hear faint notes from the piano. Christian is playing. This I must see. I love watching him play. Naked , I grab my bathrobe from the chair and wander quietly down the corridor , slipping on my robe and listening to the magical sound of the melodic lament that * s coming from the great room . Shrouded in darkness , Christian sits in a bubble of light as he plays , and his hair glints with burnished copper highlights. He looks naked , though I know he * s wearing his PJ bottoms. He * s concentrating , playing beautifully , lost in the melancholy of the music. I hesitate , watching from the shadows , not wanting to interrupt him. I want to hold him. He looks lost , sad even , and achingly lonely * or maybe it * s just the music that * s so full of poignant sorrow. He finishes the piece , pauses for a split second , then starts to play it again. I move cautiously toward him , drawn as the moth to the flame * the idea makes me smile. He glances up at me and frowns before his gaze returns to his hands . Oh , crap , is he pissed off that I am disturbing him ? * You should be asleep , * he scolds mildly . I can tell he * s preoccupied with something . * So should you , * I retort not quite as mildly . He glances up again , his lips twitching with a trace of a smile . * Are you scolding me , Miss Steele ? * * Yes , Mr. Grey , I am. * * Well , I can * t sleep. *"	no

Actually , don * t the marriage vows use those words * obey ? This throws me. Do couples still say that ? Only three months * is that why there have been so many ? He doesn * t keep them for long ? Or have they had enough after three months ? Every weekend ? That * s too much. I * ll never see Kate or whatever friends I may make at my new job , provided I get one. Perhaps I should have one weekend a month to myself. Perhaps when I have my period * that sounds * practical. He * s my master ! I * m to be dealt with as he pleases ! Holy shit . I shudder at the thought of being flogged or whipped. Spanking probably wouldn * t be so bad ; humiliating , though. And tied up ? Well , he did tie my hands together. That was * well , it was hot , really hot , so perhaps that won * t be so bad. He won * t loan me to another Dominant * damn right he won * t. That would be totally unacceptable. Why am I even thinking about this ? I can * t look him in the eye. How weird is that ? The only way I ever have any chance to see what he * s thinking. Actually , who am I kidding ? I never know what he * s thinking , but I like looking into his eyes. He has beautiful eyes * captivating , intelligent , deep , and dark , dark with dominant secrets. I recall his burning smoky gaze and press my thighs together , squirming . And I can * t touch him. Well , no surprise there. And these silly rules * No , no , I can * t do this. I put my head in my hands. This is no way to have a relationship. I need some sleep. I * m shattered. All the physical shenanigans I * ve been engaged in over the last twenty-four hours have been , frankly , exhausting. And mentally * oh , man , this is so much to handle. As Jos * would say , a real mind-fuck. Perhaps in the morning this might not read like a bad joke . I scramble up and change quickly. Perhaps I should borrow Kate * s pink flannel pajamas. I want something cuddly and reassuring around me. I head to the bathroom in my T-shirt and sleep shorts and brush my teeth . I stare at myself in the bathroom mirror. You can * t seriously be considering this * My subconscious sounds sane and rational , not her usual snarky self. My inner goddess is jumping"	maybe

Suddenly his hand is in my hair , tugging it so my head tips back , and his other hand travels down to the base of my spine. He kisses me , long , hard , and passionately , his tongue in my mouth. His breathing is mounting , his ardor * Holy cow * his erection * we * re in a field. But I don * t care. My hands twist in his hair , anchoring him to me. I want him , here , now , on the ground. He breaks away and gazes down at me , his eyes now dark and luminous in the early morning light , full of raw , arrogant sensuality. Wow. He takes my breath away . * Breakfast , * he whispers , making it sound deliciously erotic . How can he make bacon and eggs sound like forbidden fruit ? It * s an extraordinary skill. He turns , clasping my hand , and we head back toward the car . * What about the glider ? * * Someone will take care of that , * he says dismissively. * We * ll eat now. * His tone is unequivocal . Food ! He * s talking food , when really all I want is him . * Come. * He smiles . I have never seen him like this , and it * s a joy to behold. I find myself walking beside him , hand in hand , with a stupid , goofy grin plastered on my face. It reminds me of when I was ten and spent the day at Disneyland with Ray. It was a perfect day , and this is sure shaping out to be the same . BACK IN THE CAR , as we head back along Interstate 95 toward Savannah , my phone alarm goes off. Oh yes * my pill . * What * s that ? * Christian asks , curious , glancing at me . I fumble in my purse for the packet . * Alarm for my pill , * I mutter as my cheeks flush . His lips quirk up . * Good , well done. I hate condoms. * I flush some more. He * s as patronizing as ever . * I like that you introduced me to Mark as your girlfriend , * I murmur . * Isn * t that what you are ? * He raises an eyebrow . * Am I ? I thought you wanted a submissive. * * So did I , Anastasia , and I do. But I * ve told you , I want more , too. * Oh my.

Punished * whipped , beaten , whatever their relationship entailed * he feels undeserving of love. Why does he feel like that ? How can he feel like that ? His words haunt me : It * s very hard to grow up in a perfect family when you * re not perfect . I close my eyes , imagining his pain , and I can * t begin to comprehend it. I shudder as I remember that I may have divulged too much. What have I confessed to Christian in my sleep ? What secrets have I revealed ? I stare at the BlackBerry in the vague hope that it will give me some answers. Rather unsurprisingly , it is not very forthcoming. As we haven * t taken off yet , I decide to e-mail my Fifty Shades .

Play the other one. * * Other one ? * * The Bach piece that you played the first night I stayed. * * Oh , the Marcello. * He starts to play slowly and deliberately. I feel the movement of his hands in his shoulders as I lean against him and close my eyes. The sad , soulful notes swirl slowly and mournfully around us , echoing off the walls. It is a hauntingly beautiful piece , sadder even than the Chopin , and I lose myself to the beauty of the lament. To a certain extent , it reflects how I feel. The deep poignant longing I have to know this extraordinary man better , to try to understand his sadness. All too soon , the piece is at an end . * Why do you only play such sad music ? * I sit upright and gaze up at him as he shrugs in answer to my question , his expression wary . * So you were just six when you started to play ? * I prompt . He nods , his wary look intensifying.

They are exquisitely designed fancy European lingerie. All pale blue lace and finery. Wow. I am in awe and slightly daunted by this underwear. What * s more , they fit perfectly. But of course they do. I flush to think of Buzz Cut in some lingerie store buying this for me. I wonder what else is in his job description . I dress quickly. The rest of the clothing is a perfect fit. I brusquely towel-dry my hair and try desperately to bring it under control.

My breathing is still ragged as I come down from my orgasm. His hand moves down my waist , to my hips , and then cups me , intimately * Jeez. His finger slips through the fine lace and slowly circles around me * there. Briefly he closes his eyes , and his breathing hitches . * You * re so deliciously wet. God , I want you. * He thrusts his finger inside me , and I cry out as he does it again and again. He palms my clitoris , and I cry out once more. He pushes inside me harder and harder still.

Please go to sleep. * * Good night , Christian. * * Good night , Ana. * And I slip into a dazed and exhausted sleep , dreaming of a four-year-old gray-eyed boy in a dark , scary , miserable place . CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE There is light everywhere. Bright , warm , piercing light , and I endeavor to keep it at bay for a few more precious minutes. I want to hide , just a few more minutes. But the glare is too strong , and I finally succumb to wakefulness. A glorious Seattle morning greets me * sunshine pouring through the full-height windows and flooding the room with too-bright light. Why didn * t we close the blinds last night ? I am in Christian Grey * s vast bed minus one Christian Grey . I lie back for a moment staring through the windows at the lofty vista of Seattle * s skyline. Life in the clouds sure feels unreal. A fantasy * a castle in the air , adrift from the ground , safe from the realities of life * far away from neglect , hunger , and crack-whore mothers. I shudder to think what he went through as a small child , and I understand why he lives here , isolated , surrounded by beautiful , precious works of art * so far removed from where he started * mission statement indeed. I frown because it still doesn * t explain why I can * t touch him . Ironically , I feel the same up here in his lofty tower. I * m adrift from reality. I * m in this fantasy apartment , having fantasy sex with my fantasy boyfriend , when the grim reality is he wants a special arrangement , though he * s said he * ll try more. What does that actually mean ? This is what I need to clarify between us to see if we are still at opposite ends on the seesaw or if we are inching closer together . I clamber out of bed feeling stiff and , for want of a better expression , well used. Yes , that would be all the sex then. My subconscious purses her lips in disapproval. I roll my eyes at her , grateful that a certain twitchy-palmed control freak is not in the room , and resolve to ask him about the personal trainer. That * s if I sign. My inner goddess glares at me in desperation. Of course you * ll sign. I ignore them both , and after a quick trip to the bathroom , I go in search of Christian .

Perhaps I should be stricter with you. * He cocks his head to one side and gives me an artful smile . I swallow. Jeez , no. But at the same time , my muscles clench deliciously deep inside. It is his way of showing that he cares. Perhaps the only way he can show he cares * I realize that. He * s staring at me , gauging my reaction . * Was it that bad when I spanked you the first time ? * I gaze back at him , blinking. Was it that bad ? I remember feeling confused by my reaction. It hurt , but not that much in retrospect. He * s said over and over again it * s more in my head. And the second time * Well , that was good * hot . * No , not really , * I whisper . * It * s more the idea of it ? * he prompts . * I suppose. Feeling pleasure , when one isn * t supposed to. * * I remember feeling the same. Takes a while to get your head around it. * Holy hell. This was when he was a kid . * You can always use the safeword , Anastasia. Don * t forget that. And , as long as you follow the rules , which fulfill a deep need in me for control and to keep you safe , then perhaps we can find a way forward. * * Why do you need to control me ? * * Because it satisfies a need in me that wasn * t met in my formative years. * * So it * s a form of therapy ? * * I * ve not thought of it like that , but yes , I suppose it is. * This I can understand. This will help . * But , here * s the thing * one moment you say * don * t defy me , * the next you say you like to be challenged.

He pushes the tip into my mouth so I can taste the smooth , rich leather . * Suck , * he commands , his voice soft. My mouth closes over the tip as I obey . * Enough , * he snaps . I * m panting once more as he tugs the crop out of my mouth , trails it down and under my chin , on down my neck to the hollow at the base of my throat.

She * s practically the same color as her shiny red hair . * Shall I give you folks another minute to decide ? * * No. We know what we want. * Christian * s mouth twitches with a small , sexy smile . * We * ll have two portions of the original buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup and bacon on the side , two glasses of orange juice , one black coffee with skim milk , and one English breakfast tea , if you have it , * says Christian , not taking his eyes off me . * Thank you , sir. Will that be all ? * Leandra whispers , looking anywhere but at the two of us. We both turn to stare at her , and she flushes crimson again and scuttles away . * You know , it * s really not fair. * I glance down at the Formica tabletop , tracing a pattern on it with my index finger , trying to sound nonchalant . * What * s not fair ? * * How you disarm people. Women. Me. * * Do I disarm you ? * I snort. * All the time. * * It * s just looks , Anastasia , * he says mildly . * No , Christian , it * s much more than that. * His brow creases. * You disarm me totally , Miss Steele. Your innocence. It cuts through all the crap. * * Is that why you * ve changed your mind ? * * Changed my mind ? * * Yes * about * er * us ? * He strokes his chin thoughtfully with his long , skilled fingers. * I don * t think I * ve changed my mind per se. We just need to redefine our parameters , redraw our battle lines , if you will. We can make this work , I * m sure. I want you submissive in my playroom. I will punish you if you digress from the rules. Other than that * well , I think it * s all up for discussion. Those are my requirements , Miss Steele. What say you to that ? * * So I get to sleep with you ? In your bed ? * * Is that what you want ? * * Yes. * * I agree then. Besides , I sleep very well when you * re in my bed. I had no idea. * His brow creases as his voice fades . * I was frightened you * d leave me if I didn * t agree to all of it , * I whisper . * I * m not going anywhere , Anastasia.

We sink slowly to the floor , and he wraps his arms around me , imprisoning me. Will it always be like this ? So overwhelming , so all-consuming , so bewildering and beguiling. I wanted to talk , but now I * m spent and dazed from his lovemaking and wondering if I will ever get enough of him ? I am curled on his lap , my head against his chest , as we both calm. Very subtly , I inhale his sweet , intoxicating Christian scent. I must not nuzzle. I must not nuzzle. I repeat the mantra in my head * though I am so tempted to do so. I want to lift my hand and draw patterns in his chest hair with my fingertips * but I resist , knowing that he * ll hate it if I do. We are both quiet , lost in our thoughts. I am lost in him * lost to him . I remember that I have my period . * I * m bleeding , * I murmur . * Doesn * t bother me , * he breathes . * I noticed. * I can * t keep the dryness out of my voice . He tenses. * Does it bother you ? * he asks softly . Does it bother me ? Maybe it should * should it ? No , it doesn * t. I lean back and look up at him , and he gazes down at me , his eyes a soft cloudy gray . * No , not at all. * He smirks. * Good. Let * s have a bath. * He uncurls from around me , placing me on the floor as he makes to stand. As he does , I notice again the small , round white scars on his chest. They are not chicken pox , I muse absentmindedly. Grace said he was hardly affected. Holy shit * they must be burns. Burns from what ? I blanch at the realization , shock and revulsion coursing through me. From cigarettes ? Mrs. Robinson , his birth mother , who ? Who did this to him ? Maybe there * s a reasonable explanation , and I * m overreacting * wild hope blossoms in my chest , hope that I am wrong . * What is it ? * Christian * s face is wide-eyed with alarm . * Your scars , * I whisper. * They * re not from chicken pox. * I watch as in a split second he closes down , his stance changing from relaxed , calm , and at ease to defensive * angry even. He frowns , his face darkening , and his mouth presses"	yes

You * ve had six orgasms so far and all of them belong to me , * he boasts , playful again . I flush and blink at the same time , as he stares down at me. He * s keeping count ! His brow furrows . * Do you have something to tell me ? * his voice is suddenly stern . I frown. Crap . * I had a dream this morning. * * Oh ? * He glares at me . Double crap. Am I in trouble ? * I came in my sleep. * I throw my arm over my eyes. He says nothing. I peek up at him from under my arm , and he looks amused . * In your sleep ? * * Woke me up. * * I * m sure it did. What were you dreaming about ? * Crap . * You. * * What was I doing ? * I throw my arm over my eyes again. And like a small child , I briefly entertain the thought that if I can * t see him , then he can * t see me . * Anastasia , what was I doing ? I won * t ask you again. * * You had a riding crop. * He moves my arm . * Really ? * * Yes. * I am crimson . * There * s hope for you yet , * he murmurs. * I have several riding crops. * * Brown plaited leather ? * He laughs. * No , but I * m sure I could get one. * Leaning down , he gives me a brief kiss , then stands and grabs his boxers. Oh no * he * s going. I glance quickly at the time * it * s only nine forty. I scoot out of bed , too , and grab my sweatpants and a cami top , then sit back on the bed , cross-legged , watching him. I don * t want him to go. What can I do ? * When is your period due ? * He interrupts my thoughts . What ? * I hate wearing these things , * he grumbles. He holds up the condom , then puts it on the floor and slips on his jeans . * Well ? * he prompts when I don * t reply , and he looks at me expectantly as if he * s waiting for my opinion on the weather. Holy crap * this is personal stuff . * Next week. * I stare down at my hands . * You need"	maybe

Well , you get an A in that. * I flush , and my inner goddess smacks her lips together , glowing with pride . * So. * He looks down at me grinning. * Swallowing semen okay ? * I nod , not able to look him in the eye , and drain my cup again . * More ? * he asks . * More. * And I * m suddenly reminded of our conversation earlier today as he refills my cup. Is he referring to that or just the champagne ? Is this whole champagne thing more ? * Sex toys ? * he asks . I shrug , glancing down the list . Does the Submissive consent to the use of : * Vibrators * Butt plugs * Dildos * Other vaginal/anal toys * Butt plug ? Does it do what it says on the box ? * I scrunch my nose up in distaste . * Yes , * he smiles. * And I refer to anal intercourse above. Training. * * Oh * what * s in other ? * * Beads , eggs * that sort of stuff. * * Eggs ? * I * m alarmed . * Not real eggs. * He laughs loudly , shaking his head . I purse my lips at him . * I * m glad you find me funny. * I can * t keep my injured feelings out of my voice . He stops laughing . * I apologize. Miss Steele , I * m sorry , * he says , trying to look contrite , but his eyes are still dancing with humor. * Any problem with toys ? * * No , * I snap . * Anastasia , * he cajoles. * I am sorry. Believe me. I don * t mean to laugh. I * ve never had this conversation in so much detail. You * re just so inexperienced. I * m sorry. * His eyes are big and gray and sincere . I thaw a little and take another sip of champagne . * Right * bondage , * he says , returning to the list. I examine the list , and my inner goddess bounces up and down like a small child waiting for ice cream . Does the Submissive consent to : * Bondage with rope * Bondage with leather cuffs * Bondage with handcuffs/shackles/manacles * Bondage with tape * Bondage with other Christian raises his eyebrow. * Well ? * * Fine , * I whisper and quickly look back at the list .

The only man I * ve ever been attracted to , and he comes with a bloody contract , a flogger , and a whole world of issues. Well , at least I got my way this weekend. My inner goddess stops jumping and smiles serenely. Oh yes * she mouths , nodding at me smugly. I flush at the memory of his hands and his mouth on me , his body inside mine. Closing my eyes , I feel the familiar delicious pull of my muscles from deep , deep down. I want to do that again and again. Maybe if I just sign up for the sex * would he go with that ? I suspect not . Am I submissive ? Maybe I come across that way. Maybe I misled him in the interview. I * m shy , yes * but submissive ? I let Kate bully me * is that the same ? And those soft limits , jeez. My mind boggles , but I * m reassured that they are up for discussion . I wander back to my bedroom. This is too much to think about. I need a clear head * a fresh morning approach to the problem. I put the offending documents in my backpack. Tomorrow * tomorrow is another day. Clambering into bed , I switch off the light and lie staring up at the ceiling. Oh , I wish I * d never met him. My inner goddess shakes her head at me. She and I know it * s a lie. I have never felt as alive as I do now . I close my eyes , and I drift into a heavy sleep with occasional dreams of four-poster beds and shackles and intense gray eyes . KATE WAKES ME THE next day . * Ana , I * ve been calling you. You must have been out cold. * My eyes reluctantly open. She * s not just up * she * s been for a run. I glance at my alarm. It * s eight in the morning. Holy Moses , I * ve slept for a solid nine hours . * What is it ? * I mumble sleepily . * There * s a man here with a delivery for you. You have to sign for it. * * What ? * * Come on. It * s big. It looks interesting. * She hops from foot to foot excitedly and bounds back into the living room.

I stroke the leather appreciatively and wonder idly what Christian does on that couch. My mind wanders as I think of the possibilities * no * I must not go there now. I flush at my wayward and inappropriate thoughts. The receptionist is a young African-American woman with large silver earrings and long straightened hair. She has a bohemian look about her , the sort of woman I could be friendly with. The thought is comforting. Every few moments she glances up at me , away from her computer , and smiles reassuringly. I tentatively return her smile . My flight is booked , my mother is in seventh heaven that I am visiting , I am packed , and Kate has agreed to drive me to the airport. Christian has ordered me to take my BlackBerry and the Mac. I roll my eyes at the memory of his overbearing bossiness , but I realize now that * s just the way he is. He likes control over everything , including me. Yet he * s so unpredictably and disarmingly agreeable , too. He can be tender , good-humored , even sweet. And when he is , it * s so left field and unexpected. He insisted on accompanying me all the way down to my car in the garage. Jeez , I * m only going for a few days ; he * s acting like I * m going for weeks. He always keeps me off balance . * Ana Steele ? * A woman with long , black , pre-Raphaelite hair standing by the reception desk distracts me from my introspection. She has the same bohemian , floaty look as the receptionist. She could be in her late thirties , maybe in her forties. It * s so difficult to tell with older women . * Yes , * I reply , standing awkwardly . She gives me a polite smile , her cool hazel eyes assessing me. I am wearing one of Kate * s dresses , a black pinafore over a white blouse , and my black pumps. Very interview , I think. My hair is restrained in a tight bun , and for once the tendrils are behaving themselves. She holds her hand out to me . * Hello , Ana , my name * s Elizabeth Morgan. I * m head of human resources here at SIP. * * How do you do ? * I shake her hand. She looks very casual to be the head of HR . * Please follow me. * We go through the double doors behind the reception area into a large brightly decorated open-plan office , and from there head into a small meeting room. The walls are pale green , lined with pictures of book covers. At the head of the maple conference table sits"	maybe

Stalker , my subconscious whispers at me through the cloud of tequila that * s still floating in my brain , but somehow , because it * s him , I don * t mind . * Do you have a jacket or a purse ? * * Er * yes , I came with both. Christian , please , I need to tell Kate. She * ll worry. * His mouth presses into a hard line , and he sighs heavily . * If you must. * He sets me down and , taking my hand , leads me back into the bar. I feel weak , still drunk , embarrassed , exhausted , mortified , and , on some strange level , absolutely off-the-charts thrilled. He * s clutching my hand * such a confusing array of emotions. I * ll need at least a week to process them all . It * s noisy , crowded , and the music has started so there is a large crowd on the dance floor. Kate is not at our table , and Jos * has disappeared. Levi looks lost and forlorn on his own . * Where * s Kate ? * I shout at Levi above the noise. My head is beginning to pound in time to the thumping bass line of the music . * Dancing , * Levi shouts , and I can tell he * s mad. He * s eyeing Christian suspiciously. I struggle into my black jacket and place my small shoulder bag over my head so it sits at my hip. I * m ready to go , once I * ve seen Kate . I touch Christian * s arm and lean up and shout in his ear , * She * s on the dance floor , * brushing his hair with my nose , smelling his clean , fresh smell. All those forbidden , unfamiliar feelings that I have tried to deny surface and run amok through my drained body. I flush , and somewhere deep , deep down my muscles clench deliciously . He rolls his eyes at me and takes my hand again and leads me to the bar. He * s served immediately , no waiting for Mr. Control Freak Grey. Does everything come so easily to him ? I can * t hear what he orders. He hands me a very large glass of iced water . * Drink. * He shouts his order at me . The moving lights are twisting and turning in time to the music , casting strange colored light and shadows all over the bar and the clientele. He * s alternately green , blue , white , and a demonic red. He * s watching me intently. I take a tentative sip . * All of it , * he shouts . He * s so overbearing.

Then I need to study. * I can not hide my irritation with her as I open one of the cupboards to make supper . I AM RESTLESS THAT night , tossing and turning , dreaming of smoky gray eyes , coveralls , long legs , long fingers , and dark , dark unexplored places. I wake twice in the night , my heart pounding. Oh , I * m going to look just great tomorrow with so little sleep , I scold myself. I punch my pillow and try to settle . THE HEATHMAN IS NESTLED in the heart of downtown Portland. Its impressive brown stone edifice was completed just in time for the crash of the late 1920s. Jos * , Travis , and I are traveling in my Beetle , and Kate is in her CLK , since we can * t all fit in my car. Travis is Jos * * s friend and gopher , here to help out with the lighting. Kate has managed to acquire the use of a room at the Heathman free of charge for the morning in exchange for a credit in the article. When she explains at reception that we * re here to photograph Christian Grey , CEO , we are instantly upgraded to a suite. Just a regular-sized suite , however , as apparently Mr. Grey is already occupying the largest one in the building. An over-keen marketing executive shows us up to the suite * he * s terribly young and very nervous for some reason. I suspect Kate * s beauty and commanding manner disarm him , because he * s putty in her hands. The rooms are elegant , understated , and opulently furnished . It * s nine. We have half an hour to set up. Kate is in full flow . * Jos * , I think we * ll shoot against that wall , do you agree ? * She doesn * t wait for his reply. * Travis , clear the chairs. Ana , could you ask housekeeping to bring up some refreshments ? And let Grey know where we are. * Yes , mistress. She is so domineering. I roll my eyes but do as I * m told . Half an hour later , Christian Grey walks into our suite . Holy crap ! He * s wearing a white shirt , open at the collar , and gray flannel pants that hang from his hips. His unruly hair is still damp from a shower. My mouth goes dry looking at him * he * s so freaking hot."	no

I nod and want to say , For anything , but I can * t articulate the words as I * m too nervous , too excited . * Taylor. * He nods curtly at his driver , and we head into the building , straight to a set of elevators. Elevator ! The memory of our kiss this morning comes back to haunt me. I have thought of nothing else all day , daydreaming at the register at Clayton * s. Twice Mr. Clayton had to shout my name to bring me back to Earth. To say I * ve been distracted would be the understatement of the year. Christian glances down at me , a slight smile on his lips. Ha ! He * s thinking about it , too . * It * s only three floors , * he says dryly , his eyes dancing with amusement. He * s telepathic , surely. It * s spooky . I try to keep my face impassive as we enter the elevator. The doors close , and it * s there , the weird electrical attraction crackling between us , enslaving me. I close my eyes in a vain attempt to ignore it. He tightens his grip on my hand , and five seconds later the doors open onto the roof of the building. And there it is , a white helicopter with the name GREY ENTERPRISES HOLDINGS , INC. written in blue with the company logo on the side. Surely this is misuse of company property . He leads me to a small office where an old-timer sits behind the desk . * Here * s your flight plan , Mr. Grey. All external checks are done. It * s ready and waiting , sir. You * re free to go. * * Thank you , Joe. * Christian smiles warmly at him . Oh. Someone deserving of the polite treatment from Christian. Perhaps he * s not an employee. I stare at the old guy in awe . * Let * s go , * Christian says , and we make our way toward the helicopter. When we * re up close , it * s much bigger than I thought. I expected it to be a roadster version for two , but it has at least seven seats. Christian opens the door and directs me to one of the seats at the very front . * Sit * don * t touch anything , * he orders as he climbs in behind me . He shuts the door with a slam. I * m glad that the area is floodlit , otherwise I * d find it difficult to see inside the small cockpit. I sit down in my allotted seat , and he crouches"	maybe

It will go well with the meal , whatever we get , * he says patiently . * Whatever we get ? * * Yes. * He smiles his dazzling head-cocked-to-one-side smile , and my stomach pole vaults over my spleen. I can * t help but reflect his glorious smile back at him . * My mother liked you , * he says dryly . * Really ? * His words make me flush with pleasure . * Oh yes. She * s always thought I was gay. * My mouth drops open , and I remember that question * from the interview. Oh no . * Why did she think you were gay ? * I whisper . * Because she * s never seen me with a girl. * * Oh * not even one of the fifteen ? * He smiles . * You remembered. No , none of the fifteen. * * Oh. * * You know , Anastasia , it * s been a weekend of firsts for me , too , * he says quietly . * It has ? * * I * ve never slept with anyone , never had sex in my bed , never flown a girl in Charlie Tango , never introduced a woman to my mother. What are you doing to me ? * His eyes burn , their intensity takes my breath away . The waitress arrives with our glasses of wine , and I immediately take a quick sip. Is he opening up or just making a casual observation ? * I * ve really enjoyed this weekend , * I murmur. He narrows his eyes at me again . * Stop biting that lip , * he growls. * Me , too , * he adds . * What * s vanilla sex ? * I ask , if anything to distract myself from the intense , burning , sexy look he * s giving me. He laughs . * Just straightforward sex , Anastasia. No toys , no add-ons. * He shrugs. * You know * well , actually you don * t , but that * s what it means. * * Oh. * I thought it was chocolate fudge brownie sex that we had , with a cherry on the top. But hey , what do I know ? The waitress brings us soup. We both stare at it rather dubiously . * Nettle soup , * the waitress informs us before turning and flouncing back into the kitchen.

I slice a bagel and pop it into the toaster. I flush , remembering my vivid dream. What on Earth was that about ? Last night I found it hard to sleep. My head was buzzing with various options. I am so confused. Christian * s idea of a relationship is more like a job offer. It has set hours , a job description , and a rather harsh grievance procedure. It * s not how I envisaged my first romance * but , of course , Christian doesn * t do romance. If I tell him I want more , he may say no * and I could jeopardize what he has offered. And this is what concerns me most , because I don * t want to lose him. But I * m not sure I have the stomach to be his submissive * deep down , it * s the canes and whips that put me off. I * m a physical coward , and I will go a long way to avoid pain. I think of my dream * is that what it would be like ?

I concentrate on my bagel and listen patiently as she runs through her valedictorian speech . I AM DRESSED AND ready when Ray arrives.

Can * t a girl be pleased to see her old man ? * He smiles , his dark eyes crinkling at the corners , and follows me into the living room . * You look good , * he says . * This is Kate * s dress. * I glance down at the gray chiffon halter-neck dress . He frowns . * Where is Kate ? * * She * s gone to campus. She * s giving a speech , so she has to be early. * * Should we head on over ? * * Dad , we have half an hour. Would you like some tea ?

Shower with me * now. * I can * t decide if it * s a request or a command . * Yes , * I whisper , and he grabs my hand , leading me out of the big room into his bedroom to his bathroom . Once there , he releases me and turns the water on in the far-too-spacious shower. Spinning around slowly , he gazes at me , eyes hooded . * I like your skirt. It * s very short , * he says , his voice low. * You have great legs. * He steps out of his shoes and reaches down to take off each of his socks , never taking his eyes off me. I am rendered speechless by the look of hunger in his eyes. Wow * to be this wanted by this Greek god. I mirror his actions and step out of my black flats.

Here * fast , hard , * he breathes , and his hands are on my thighs , pushing up my skirt. * Are you still bleeding ? * * No. * I flush . * Good. * His thumbs hook over my white cotton panties , and abruptly he drops to his knees as he tugs them off. My skirt is now rucked up so that I * m naked from the waist down and panting , wanting. He grabs my hips , pushing me against the wall again , and kisses me at the apex of my thighs. Grabbing my upper thighs , he forces my legs apart. I groan loudly , feeling his tongue circling my clitoris. Oh my.

It * s so unexpected , so hot , though it * s chilled and Christian * s lips are cool . * More ? * he whispers . I nod. It tastes all the more divine because it * s been in his mouth. He leans down , and I drink another mouthful from his lips * oh my . * Let * s not go too far ; we know your capacity for alcohol is limited , Anastasia. * I can * t help it. I grin , and he leans down to deliver another delicious mouthful. He shifts so he * s lying beside me , his erection at my hip. Oh , I want him inside me . * Is this nice ? * he asks , but I hear the edge in his voice . I tense. He moves the glass again and leans down , kissing me and depositing a small shard of ice in my mouth with a little wine. He slowly and leisurely trails chilled kisses down the center of my body , from the base of my throat to between my breasts , down my torso to my belly. He pops a fragment of ice in my navel in a pool of cool , cold wine. It burns all the way down to the depths of my belly. Wow . * Now you have to keep still , * he whispers. * If you move , Anastasia , you * ll get wine all over the bed. * My hips flex automatically . * Oh no. If you spill the wine , I will punish you , Miss Steele. * I groan and desperately fight the urge to tilt my hips , pulling on my restraint. Oh no * please . With one finger , he pulls down my bra cups in turn , my breasts pushed up , exposed and vulnerable. Leaning down , he kisses and tugs at each of my nipples in turn with cool , cold lips. I fight my body as it tries to arch in response . * How nice is this ? * he breathes , blowing on one of my nipples . I hear another clink of ice , and then I can feel it around my right nipple as he tugs the left one with his lips. I moan , struggling not to move.

His eyes soften and his expression warms , and there * s a trace of a smile on his lips . * Anastasia , I don * t think so. Dark knight , maybe. * His smile is sardonic , and he shakes his head. * Did you eat last night ? * His tone is accusatory. I shake my head. What major transgression have I committed now ? His jaw clenches , but his face remains impassive . * You need to eat. That * s why you were so ill. Honestly , it * s drinking rule number one. * He runs this hand through his hair , and I know it * s because he * s exasperated . * Are you going to continue to scold me ? * * Is that what I * m doing ? * * I think so. * * You * re lucky I * m just scolding you. * * What do you mean ? * * Well , if you were mine , you wouldn * t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday.

I notice through a blur what he * s wearing : a loose white linen shirt , snug jeans , black Converse sneakers , and a dark pinstriped jacket. His shirt is unbuttoned at the top , and I see a sprinkling of hair in the gap. In my groggy frame of mind , he looks yummy . He takes my hand once more. Holy cow * he * s leading me onto the dance floor. Shit. I do not dance. He can sense my reluctance , and under the colored lights I see his amused , sardonic smile.

It * s tempting to reach out and touch him , but like a small child , he * s so lovely when he * s asleep. I don * t have to worry about what I * m saying , what he * s saying , what plans he has , especially his plans for me . I could gaze at him all day , but I have needs * bathroom needs.

Lines and lines of expensive suits , shirts , shoes , and ties. How can anyone need this many clothes ? I tut with disapproval. Actually , Kate * s wardrobe probably rivals this. Kate ! Oh no.

I * m seized by a sense of raw outrage. Poor , fucked-up , kinky , philanthropic Christian * though I * m sure he wouldn * t see himself this way and would repel any thoughts of sympathy or pity. Abruptly , everyone bursts into applause and stands. I follow , though I haven * t heard half his speech.

He turns and glances at us when we enter and smiles warmly at me . * Are you done ? * he asks as if he * s genuinely interested. He points the remote at a sleek white box beneath the fireplace that houses his iPod , and the exquisite melody fades but continues in the background. Standing , he strolls toward us . * Yes , Mr. Grey. Look after her ; she * s a beautiful , bright young woman. * Christian is taken aback * as am I. What an inappropriate thing for a doctor to say.

I put my free hand on his shoulder and grin up at him , caught in his infectious , playful mood. He sways once , then we * re off. Boy , can he dance. We cover the floor , from the window to the kitchen and back again , whirling and turning in time to the music. And he makes it so effortless for me to follow .

In his hands he holds a bowl of strawberries. He ambles with athletic grace to the front of the cage , gazing intently at me.

He stretches a little farther , and the strawberry is at my lips . * Eat , Anastasia. * His mouth forms my name , lingering sensually on each syllable .

I reach up to touch him , graze my fingers through his chest hair . * Anastasia. * No. I moan . * Come on , baby. * No. I want to touch you . * Wake up. * No. Please.

Jeez , it * s still dark , and the images of him from my dream persist , disconcerting and tantalizing in my head . * Oh * no , * I groan. I want back at his chest , back to my dream.

I am trussed up by my own bra . * Very nice , * he whispers appreciatively , and my nipples harden even more . He blows very gently on one as his hand moves to my other breast , and his thumb slowly rolls the end of my nipple , elongating it. I groan , feeling the sweet sensation all the way to my groin. I am so wet. Oh , please , I beg internally as my fingers clasp the sheet tighter. His lips close around my other nipple , and when he tugs , I nearly convulse . * Let * s see if we can make you come like this , * he whispers , continuing his slow , sensual assault. My nipples bear the delicious brunt of his deft fingers and lips , setting alight every single nerve ending so that my whole body sings with sweet agony.

I frown at my wayward thoughts and , pulling out my BlackBerry , stare at it despondently . What does Christian know of love ? Seems he didn * t get the unconditional love he was entitled to during his very early years. My heart twists , and my mother * s words waft like a zephyr through my mind : Yes , Ana. Hell , what do you need ? A neon sign flashing on his forehead ? She thinks Christian loves me , but then she * s my mother , of course she * d think that. She thinks I deserve the best of everything. I frown. It * s true , and in a moment of startling clarity , I see it. It * s very simple : I want his love. I need Christian Grey to love me. This is why I am so reticent about our relationship * because on some basic , fundamental level , I recognize within me a deep-seated compulsion to be loved and cherished . And because of his fifty shades , I am holding myself back. The BDSM is a distraction from the real issue. The sex is amazing , he * s wealthy , he * s beautiful , but this is all meaningless without his love , and the real"	no

I believe Elliot is asking Kate , too. I don * t know how you feel about that. It will be odd for me to introduce you to my family. * Odd ? Why ? * Are you ashamed of me ? * I can * t keep the wounded hurt out of my voice . * Of course not. * He rolls his eyes . * Why is it odd ? * * Because I * ve never done it before. * * Why are you allowed to roll your eyes , and I * m not ? * He blinks at me. * I wasn * t aware that I was. * * Neither am I , usually , * I snap .

He moves quickly and furiously inside me , his breathing harsh at my ear , and my body responds , melting around him. I mustn * t come. No. But I * m meeting him thrust for thrust , a perfect counterpoint. Abruptly , and all too soon , he rams into me and stills as he finds his release , air hissing through his teeth. He relaxes momentarily , so I feel his entire , delicious weight on me. I * m not ready to let him go , my body craving relief , but he * s so heavy , and in that moment , I can * t push against him.

He stands and removes the condom , knotting it at the end , and puts it in his pants pocket.

He turns back to gaze down at me , his expression softer . * We * d better get back to the house. * I sit up , a little unsteadily , dazed . * Here. You may put these on. * From his inside pocket , he produces my panties.

He turns and raises his eyebrows at me. * Just in time. Christ , she can be really irritating. * I scowl back at him , hastily restore my panties to their rightful place , and stand with as much dignity as I can muster in my just-fucked state.

He sits up on the bed and throws the used condom in a wastebasket. * Come on , we need to get dressed * that * s if you want to meet my mother. * He grins , leaps up off the bed , and pulls on his jeans * no underwear ! I struggle to sit up as I * m still tethered . * Christian * I can * t move. * His grin widens , and leaning down , he undoes the tie. The woven pattern has made an indentation around my wrists.

My T-shirts are in this drawer. My shirts are in the closet. Help yourself. * He eyes me speculatively for a moment , then leaves the room . Holy shit. Christian * s mother.

Inside me ! I gasp , and all the muscles deep in my belly clench. My inner goddess is doing the dance of the seven veils . * Then we * ll fuck , and if you * re still awake , I * ll impart some information about my formative years. Agreed ? * He * s asking my permission ! Breathlessly , I nod. I * m incapable of speech . * Good girl. Open your mouth. * Mouth ? * Wider. * Very gently , he puts the balls in my mouth . * They need lubrication. Suck , * he orders , his voice soft . The balls are cold , smooth , surprisingly heavy , and metallic tasting. My dry mouth pools with saliva as my tongue explores the unfamiliar objects. Christian * s gaze does not leave mine. Holy hell , this is turning me on. I squirm . * Keep still , Anastasia , * he warns . * Stop. * He tugs them from my mouth. Moving toward the bed , he throws the duvet aside and sits down on the edge . * Come here. * I stand in front of him . * Now turn around , bend down , and grab your ankles. * I blink at him , and his expression darkens . * Don * t hesitate , * he admonishes me softly , an undercurrent in his voice , and he pops the balls in his mouth . Fuck , this is sexier than the toothbrush. I follow his orders immediately. Jeez , can I touch my ankles ? I find I can , with ease. The T-shirt slides up my back , exposing my behind. Thank heavens I have retained my panties , but I suspect I won * t for long . He places his hand reverently on my backside and very softly caresses it with his whole hand. With my eyes open , I can see his legs through mine , nothing else. I close my eyes tightly as he gently moves my panties to the side and slowly runs his finger up and down my sex. My body braces itself in a heady mix of wild anticipation and arousal. He slides one finger inside me , and he circles it deliciously slowly. Oh , it feels good. I moan . His breathing halts and I hear him gasp as he repeats the motion. He withdraws his finger and very slowly inserts the objects , one slow , delicious ball at a time. Oh my. They * re body temperature , warmed by our collective mouths. It * s a curious feeling. Once they * re inside me"	yes
fifty_500_374	"* no * * And I find myself struggling out of his grasp , pushing him away. Fighting him . * Don * t touch me ! * I hiss. I straighten and stare at him , and he * s watching me as if I might bolt , eyes wide , bemused. I dash the tears angrily out of my eyes with the backs of my hands , glaring at him . * This is what you really like ? Me , like this ? * I use the sleeve of the bathrobe to wipe my nose . He gazes at me warily . * Well , you are one fucked-up son of a bitch. * * Ana , * he pleads , shocked . * Don * t you dare * Ana * me ! You need to sort your shit out , Grey ! * And with that , I turn stiffly , and I walk out of the playroom , closing the door quietly behind me . I clasp the door handle behind me and briefly lean back against the door. Where to go ? Do I run ? Do I stay ? I am so mad , scalding tears spill down my cheeks , and I brush them furiously aside. I just want to curl up. Curl up and recuperate in some way. Heal my shattered faith. How could I have been so stupid ? Of course it hurts . Tentatively , I rub my backside. Aah ! It * s sore. Where to go ? Not his room. My room , or the room that will be mine , no , is mine * was mine. This is why he wanted me to keep it. He knew I would need distance from him . I launch myself stiffly in that direction , conscious that Christian may follow me. It is still dark in the bedroom , dawn only a whisper in the skyline. I climb awkwardly into bed , careful not to sit on my aching and tender backside. I keep the bathrobe on , wrapping it around me , and curl up and really let go * sobbing hard into my pillow . What was I thinking ? Why did I let him do that to me ? I wanted the dark , to explore how bad it could be * but it * s too dark for me. I can not do this. Yet , this is what he does ; this is how he gets his kicks . What a monumental wake-up call. And to be fair to him , he warned me and warned me , time and again. He * s not normal. He has needs that I can not fulfill. I realize that now. I don * t want him to hit me like that again , ever. I think of the couple of times he has hit me , and how easy he was on me by"	maybe

Suspension * that * s what the carabiners are for in the playroom. Rope play. One of the ropes was tied too tightly. * I hold my hand up , begging him to stop . * I don * t need to know any more. So you won * t suspend me then ? * * Not if you really don * t want to. You can make that a hard limit. * * Okay. * * So obeying , do you think you can manage that ? * He stares at me , his gaze intense. The seconds tick by . * I could try , * I whisper . * Good. * He smiles. * Now term. One month instead of three is no time at all , especially if you want a weekend away from me each month. I don * t think I * ll be able to stay away from you for that length of time. I can barely manage it now. * He pauses . He can * t stay away from me ? What ? * How about one day over one weekend per month you get to yourself * but I get a midweek night that week ? * * Okay. * * And please , let * s try it for three months. If it * s not for you , then you can walk away anytime. * * Three months ? * I * m feeling railroaded. I take another large sip of wine and treat myself to another oyster. I could learn to like these . * The ownership thing , that * s just terminology and goes back to the principle of obeying. It * s to get you into the right frame of mind , to understand where I * m coming from. And I want you to know that as soon as you cross my threshold as my submissive , I will do what I like to you.

fifty_500_207	"* Oh , shit * can * t he just get this over with ? I * m not sure if I can stand. Hesitantly , I clamber to my feet. He holds his hand out , and I place the condom in his palm. Suddenly he grabs me , tipping me across his lap. With one smooth movement , he angles his body so my torso is resting on the bed beside him. He throws his right leg over both of mine and plants his left forearm on the small of my back , holding me down so I can not move. Oh , fuck . * Put your hands up on either side of your head , * he orders . I obey immediately . * Why am I doing this , Anastasia ? * he asks . * Because I rolled my eyes at you , * I can barely speak . * Do you think that * s polite ? * * No. * * Will you do it again ? * * No. * * I will spank you each time you do it , do you understand ? * Very slowly , he pulls down my sweatpants.

He places his hand on my naked behind , softly fondling me , stroking around and around with his flat palm. And then his hand is no longer there * and he hits me * hard. Ow ! My eyes spring open in response to the pain , and I try to rise , but his hand moves between my shoulder blades , keeping me down. He caresses me again where he * s hit me , and his breathing * s changed * it * s louder , harsher. He hits me again and again , quickly in succession. Holy fuck it hurts. I make no sound , my face screwed up against the pain. I try to wriggle away from the blows * spurred on by adrenaline spiking and coursing through my body . * Keep still , * he growls , * or I * ll spank you for longer. * He * s rubbing me now , and the blow follows. A rhythmic pattern emerges : caress , fondle , hard slap. I have to concentrate to handle this pain. My mind empties as I endeavor to absorb the grueling sensation. He doesn * t hit me in the same place twice in succession * he * s spreading the pain . * Aargh ! * I cry out on the tenth slap * and I * m unaware that I have been mentally counting the blows . * I * m just getting warmed up. * He hits me again , then he"	yes

He moves to the bottom of the bed and grabs both of my ankles . * Lift your head again , * he orders . I comply , and he drags me down the bed so that my arms are stretched out and almost straining at the cuffs. Holy cow , I can not move my arms. A frisson of trepidation mixed with tantalizing exhilaration sweeps through my body , making me wetter. I groan. Parting my legs , he cuffs first my right ankle and then my left so I am staked out , spread-eagled , and totally vulnerable to him. It * s so unnerving that I can * t see him. I listen hard * what * s he doing ? And I hear nothing , just my breathing and the pounding thud of my heart as blood pulses furiously against my eardrums . Abruptly , the soft silent hiss and pop of the iPod springs into life.

He strolls purposefully down the path toward his car as he runs his hand through his hair. Glancing up as he opens his car door , he smiles his breathtaking smile. My answering smile is weak , completely dazzled by him , and I * m reminded once more of Icarus soaring too close to the sun. I close the front door as he climbs into his sports car. I have an overwhelming urge to cry ; a sad and lonely melancholy grips and tightens around my heart.

The water rises as he sits and pulls me against his chest. He places his long legs over mine , his knees bent and his ankles level with mine , and he pulls his feet apart , opening my legs. I gasp in surprise. His nose is in my hair and he inhales deeply . * You smell so good , Anastasia. * A tremor runs through my whole body. I am naked in a bath with Christian Grey. He * s naked. If someone had told me I * d be doing this when I woke up in his hotel suite yesterday , I would not have believed them . He reaches for a bottle of body wash from the built-in shelf beside the bath and squirts some into his hand. He rubs his hands together , creating a soft , foaming lather , and he closes his hands around my neck and starts to rub the soap into my neck and shoulders , massaging firmly with his long , strong fingers. I groan. His hands on me feel good . * You like that ? * I can almost hear his smile . * Hmm. * He moves down my arms , then beneath them to my underarms , washing gently. I * m so glad Kate insisted I shave. His hands glide across to my breasts , and I inhale sharply as his fingers encircle them and start kneading gently , taking no prisoners. My body bows instinctively , pushing my breasts into his hands. My nipples are tender. Very tender , no doubt , from his less-than-delicate treatment of them last night. He doesn * t linger long and glides his hands down to my stomach and belly. My breathing increases and my heart is racing. His growing erection presses against my behind. It * s such a turn-on knowing that it * s my body making him feel this way. Ha * not your mind , my subconscious sneers. I shake off the unwelcome thought . He stops and reaches for a washcloth as I pant against him , wanting * needing. My hands rest on his firm , muscular thighs. Squirting more soap onto the washcloth , he leans down and washes between my legs. I hold my breath. His fingers skillfully stimulating me through the cloth , it * s heavenly , and my hips start moving at their own rhythm , pushing against his hand. As the sensations take over , I tilt my head back , my eyes rolling to the back of my head , my mouth slack , and I groan.

Olivia scoots up and scurries to a door on the other side of the foyer . * My apologies , Miss Steele , Olivia is our new intern. Please be seated. Mr. Grey will be another five minutes. * Olivia returns with a glass of iced water . * Here you go , Miss Steele. * * Thank you. * Blonde Number Two marches over to the large desk , her heels clicking and echoing on the sandstone floor. She sits down , and they both continue their work . Perhaps Mr. Grey insists on all his employees being blonde. I * m wondering idly if that * s legal , when the office door opens and a tall , elegantly dressed , attractive African American man with short dreads exits. I have definitely worn the wrong clothes . He turns and says through the door , * Golf this week , Grey ? * I don * t hear the reply. He turns , sees me , and smiles , his dark eyes crinkling at the corners. Olivia has jumped up and called the elevator. She seems to excel at jumping from her seat. She * s more nervous than me ! * Good afternoon , ladies , * he says as he departs through the sliding door . * Mr. Grey will see you now , Miss Steele. Do go through , * Blonde Number Two says.

The beauty of traveling first class is that they let you off the plane first . My mom is waiting with Bob , and it is so good to see them. I don * t know if it * s because of exhaustion , the long journey , or the whole Christian situation , but as soon as I * m in my mother * s arms , I burst into tears . * Oh , Ana , honey.

He takes my backpack . * Jeez , Ana , what have you got in here ? * That would be the Mac , and they both put their arms around me as we head for the parking lot .

It saps everything. I have to struggle out of Mom and Bob * s embrace so I can remove my hoodie. I am so glad I packed shorts. I miss the dry heat of Las Vegas sometimes , where I lived with Mom and Bob when I was seventeen , but this wet heat , even at 8 : 30 in the morning , takes some getting used to. By the time I * m in the back of Bob * s wonderfully air-conditioned Tahoe SUV , I feel limp , and my hair has started a frizzy protest at the heat.

My breathing is ragged as I pant , gazing at him with delicious anticipation. He grabs my face with both hands , holding me firmly , and he kisses me hard , thrusting his tongue into my mouth so I can taste my arousal. Unzipping his fly , he frees himself , grabs the backs of my thighs , and lifts me . * Wrap your legs around me , baby , * he commands , his voice urgent , strained . I do as I * m told and wrap my arms around his neck , and he moves quickly and sharply , filling me. Ah ! He gasps , and I groan. Holding my behind , his fingers digging into my soft flesh , he begins to move , slowly at first * a steady even tempo * but as his control unravels , he speeds up * faster and faster. Ahhh ! I tip my head back and concentrate on the invading , punishing , heavenly sensation * pushing me , pushing me * onward , higher , up * and when I can take no more , I explode around him , spiraling into an intense , all-consuming orgasm. He lets go with a deep growl , and he buries his head in my neck as he buries himself inside me , groaning loudly and incoherently as he finds his release . His breathing is erratic , but he kisses me tenderly , not moving , still inside me , and I blink , unseeing , into his eyes. As he comes into focus , he gently pulls out of me , holding me steady while I place my feet on the floor. The bathroom is now cloudy with steam * and hot. I feel overdressed . * You seem pleased to see me , * I murmur with a shy smile . His lips quirk up. * Yes , Miss Steele , I think my pleasure is pretty self-evident. Come * let me get you in the shower. * He undoes the next three buttons of his shirt , removes the cuff links , tugs it over his head , and discards it on the floor. Taking off his suit pants and boxer briefs , he kicks them to one side. He begins to undo the buttons on my blouse while I watch him , yearning to reach out and stroke his chest , but I contain myself . * How was your journey ? * he asks mildly. He seems so much calmer now , his apprehension gone , dissolved by sexual congress . * Fine , thank you , * I murmur , still breathless. * Thanks once again for first class.

It smells delicious * chorizo and scallops with roasted red peppers and shallots , sprinkled with flat-leaf parsley. And in spite of the fact that my stomach is churning from Christian * s veiled threats , the surreptitious glances from pretty little Miss Pigtails , and the debacle of my missing underwear , I am starving. I flush as I realize it * s the physical effort of this afternoon that * s given me such an appetite . Moments later Grace returns , her brow furrowed. Mr. Grey cocks his head to one side * like Christian . * Everything okay ? * * Another measles case. * Grace sighs . * Oh no. * * Yes , a child. The fourth case this month. If only people would get their kids vaccinated. * She shakes her head sadly , and then smiles. * I * m so glad our children never went through that. They never caught anything worse than chicken pox , thank goodness. Poor Elliot , * she says as she sits down , smiling indulgently at her son.

They got it so mildly , only a spot to share between them. * Mia giggles , and Christian rolls his eyes . * So , did you catch the Mariners game , Dad ? * Elliot * s clearly keen to move the conversation on . The hors d * oeuvres are delicious , and I concentrate on eating while Elliot , Mr. Grey , and Christian talk baseball. Christian seems relaxed and calm talking to his family. My mind is working furiously. Damn Kate , what game is she playing ? Will he punish me ? I quail at the thought. I haven * t signed that contract yet. Perhaps I won * t. Perhaps I * ll stay in Georgia where he can * t reach me . * How are you settling into your new apartment , dear ? * Grace asks politely .

So we * ll end up by the wall over there. * He points with the riding crop to where the large wooden X is on the wall . * Put your hands above your head. * I oblige immediately , feeling like I * m exiting my body * a casual observer of events as they unfold around me. This is beyond fascinating , beyond erotic. It * s singularly the most exciting and scary thing I * ve ever done. I * m entrusting myself to a beautiful man who , by his own admission , is fifty shades of fucked up. I suppress the brief thrill of fear. Kate and Elliot , they know I * m here . He stands very close as he fastens the cuffs. I * m staring at his chest. His proximity is heavenly. He smells of body wash and Christian , an inebriating mix , and that drags me back into the now. I want to run my nose and tongue through that smattering of chest hair. I could just lean forward * He steps back and gazes at me , his expression hooded , salacious , carnal , and I am helpless , my hands tied , but just looking at his lovely face , reading his need and longing for me , I can feel the dampness between my legs.

I like that. * Standing in front of me again , he hooks his fingers into my panties and , at a most unhurried pace , peels them down my legs , stripping me agonizingly slowly , so that he ends up kneeling in front of me. Not taking his eyes off mine , he scrunches my panties in his hand , holds them up to his nose , and inhales deeply. Holy fuck. Did he just do that ? He grins wickedly at me and tucks them into the pocket of his jeans . Uncoiling from the floor , rising lazily , like a jungle cat , he points the end of the riding crop at my navel , leisurely circling it * tantalizing me.

As I ride up to the thirtieth floor , a thousand butterflies stretch their wings and flutter erratically in my stomach. Why am I so nervous ? And I know it * s because I have no idea what kind of mood Christian * s going to be in when I arrive. My inner goddess is hopeful for one type of mood ; my subconscious , like me , is fraught with nerves . The elevator doors open , and I * m in the foyer. It is so strange not to be met by Taylor. Of course , he * s parking the car. In the great room , Christian is on his BlackBerry , talking quietly as he stares through the glass doors at the early evening Seattle skyline. He * s wearing a gray suit with the jacket undone , and he * s running his hand through his hair. He * s agitated , tense even. Oh no * what * s wrong ? Agitated or not , he * s still a fine sight. How can he look so * arresting ? * No trace * Okay * Yes. * He turns and sees me , and his whole demeanor changes. From tension to relief to something else : a look that calls directly to my inner goddess , a look of sensual carnality , his eyes scorching . My mouth goes dry and desire blooms in my body * whoa . * Keep me informed , * he snaps , and shuts off his phone as he strides purposefully toward me. I stand paralyzed as he closes the distance between us , devouring me with his eyes. Holy shit * something * s amiss * the strain in his jaw , the anxiety around his eyes. He shrugs out of his jacket , undoes his dark tie , and slings them both onto the couch en route to me. Then his arms are wrapped around me , and he * s pulling me to him , hard , fast , gripping my ponytail to tilt my head up , kissing me like his life depends on it. What the hell ? He drags the hair tie painfully out of my hair , but I don * t care. There * s a desperate , primal quality to his kiss.

He * s obviously nothing like Christian , but then they * re adopted brothers . * Hi , Elliot. * I smile at him , and I * m aware that I * m biting my lip . * Elliot , we * d better go , * Christian says mildly . * Sure. * He turns to Kate and pulls her into his arms and gives her a long , lingering kiss . Jeez * get a room. I stare at my feet , embarrassed. I glance up at Christian , and he * s watching me intently. I narrow my eyes at him. Why can * t you kiss me like that ? Elliot continues to kiss Kate , sweeping her off her feet and dipping her in a dramatic hold so that her hair touches the ground as he kisses her hard . * Laters , baby. * He grins . Kate just melts. I * ve never seen her melt before * the words * comely * and * compliant * come to mind. Compliant Kate. Boy , Elliot must be good. Christian rolls his eyes and stares down at me , his expression unreadable , although maybe he * s mildly amused. He tucks a stray strand of my hair that has worked its way free from my ponytail behind my ear. My breath hitches at the contact , and I lean my head into his fingers. His eyes soften , and he runs his thumb across my lower lip. My blood sears in my veins. And all too quickly , his touch is gone . * Laters , baby , * he murmurs , and I have to laugh because it * s so unlike him. But even though I know he * s being irreverent , the endearment tugs at something deep inside me . * I * ll pick you up at eight. * He turns to leave , opening the front door and stepping out onto the porch. Elliot follows him to the car but turns and blows Kate another kiss , and I feel an unwelcome pang of jealousy . * So , did you ? * Kate asks as we watch them climb into the car and drive off , the burning curiosity evident in her voice . * No , * I snap irritably , hoping that will halt the questions.

Face up , * he adds as he smacks me hard on the behind , making me jump . Hastily , I crawl onto the bed * s hard , unyielding mattress and lie down , looking up at him. The satin of the sheet beneath me is soft and cool against my skin. His face is impassive , except for his eyes , which glow with a barely leashed excitement . * Hands above your head , * he orders , and I do as I * m bid . Jeez , my body hungers for him. I want him already . He turns , and out of the corner of my eyes , I watch him saunter back over to the chest of drawers , returning with the iPod and what looks like an eye mask , similar to the one I used on my flight to Atlanta. The thought makes me want to smile , but I can * t quite make my lips cooperate. I am too consumed with anticipation. I just know my face is completely immobile , my eyes huge , as I gaze at him . Sitting down on the edge of the bed , he shows me the iPod. It has a strange antenna device as well as headphones. How odd. I frown as I try to figure this out . * This transmits what * s playing on the iPod to the system in the room , * Christian answers my unspoken query as he taps the small antenna. * I can hear what you * re hearing , and I have a remote control unit for it. * He smirks his private-joke smile and holds up a small , flat device that looks like a very hip calculator. He leans across me , inserting the earbuds gently into my ears , and puts the iPod down somewhere on the bed above my head . * Lift your head , * he commands , and I do so immediately . Slowly , he slides the mask on , pulling the elastic over the back of my head , and I * m blind. The elastic on the mask holds the earbuds in place. I can still hear him , though the sound is muffled as he rises from the bed. I * m deafened by my own breathing * it * s shallow and erratic , reflecting my excitement. Christian takes my left arm , stretches it gently to the left-hand corner , and attaches the leather cuff around my wrist. His long fingers stroke the length of my arm once he * s finished. Oh !

Very slowly he eases into me and starts to move. Oh * my. The feeling is sore and sweet and bold and gentle all at once . * How * s this ? * he breathes . * Fine. Good , * I breathe. And he really starts to move , fast , hard , and large , thrusting into me over and over , implacable , pushing me and pushing me until I am close to the edge again.

Then he stills , his body rigid . Collapsing on top of me , I feel his full weight forcing me into the mattress. I pull my tied hands over his neck and hold him the best I can.

He reaches up and grabs my pigtails and starts to really move . * Oh * baby * that feels good , * he murmurs. I suck harder , flicking my tongue across the head of his impressive erection. Wrapping my teeth behind my lips , I clamp my mouth around him. His breath hisses between his teeth , and he groans . * Jesus. How far can you go ? * he whispers . Hmm * I pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him at the back of my throat and then to the front again. My tongue swirls around the end. He * s my very own Christian Grey * flavored popsicle. I suck harder and harder , pushing him deeper and deeper , swirling my tongue around and around. Hmm * I had no idea giving pleasure could be such a turn-on , watching him writhe subtly with carnal longing. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves . * Anastasia , I * m going to come in your mouth , * his breathy tone is warning. * If you don * t want me to , stop now. * He thrusts his hips again , his eyes are wide , wary , and filled with salacious need * need for me.

I * m angled across his lap again so that my torso rests on the bed beside him. This time he doesn * t throw his leg over mine but smoothes my hair out of my face and tucks it behind my ear. Once he * s done , he clasps my hair at the nape to hold me in place.

He caresses my backside again , trailing his palm across my skin and over my underwear . Why * s he not removed my panties ? Then his palm disappears , and he brings it down again. I groan as the sensation spreads. He starts a pattern : left to right and then down. The down ones are the best.

It * s somehow manageable and , yes , pleasurable * even. I groan. Yes , I can do this . He pauses as he slowly peels my panties down my legs.

He switches off the engine . * You up for this ? * he asks . * You * re flying ? * * Yes. * * Yes , please ! * I don * t hesitate.

No * he said that he * s done it before. I relax. He walks around and opens my door. The sky has turned to a subtle opal , shimmering and glowing softly behind the sporadic childlike clouds. Dawn is upon us . Taking my hand , Christian leads me around the building to a large stretch of tarmac where several planes are parked. Waiting beside them is a man with a shaved head and a wild look in his eye , accompanied by Taylor . Taylor ! Does Christian go anywhere without that man ? I beam at him , and he smiles kindly back at me . * Mr. Grey , this is your tow pilot , Mr. Mark Benson , * says Taylor.

I cry out a wordless , passionate plea as I touch the sun and burn , falling around him , falling down , back to a breathless , bright summit on Earth.

Kate is more concerned about what she * s going to wear to the bar this evening. I am busily fishing around in my purse for my keys . * Ana , there * s a package for you. * Kate is standing on the steps up to the front door holding a brown paper parcel. Odd.

He * s so close. I could just reach up and touch him . * You can sit down now. * He halts my scattered thoughts , and I scoot down into the warm , welcoming water. Ooh * it stings and that takes me by surprise , but it smells heavenly , too. The initial smarting pain soon ebbs away. I lie back and briefly close my eyes , relaxing in the soothing warmth.

fifty_500_0	"CHAPTER ONE I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror. Damn my hair * it just won * t behave , and damn Katherine Kavanagh for being ill and subjecting me to this ordeal. I should be studying for my final exams , which are next week , yet here I am trying to brush my hair into submission. I must not sleep with it wet. I must not sleep with it wet. Reciting this mantra several times , I attempt , once more , to bring it under control with the brush. I roll my eyes in exasperation and gaze at the pale , brown-haired girl with blue eyes too big for her face staring back at me , and give up. My only option is to restrain my wayward hair in a ponytail and hope that I look semi-presentable . Kate is my roommate , and she has chosen today of all days to succumb to the flu. Therefore , she can not attend the interview she * d arranged to do , with some mega-industrialist tycoon I * ve never heard of , for the student newspaper. So I have been volunteered. I have final exams to cram for and one essay to finish , and I * m supposed to be working this afternoon , but no * today I have to drive 165 miles to downtown Seattle in order to meet the enigmatic CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc. As an exceptional entrepreneur and major benefactor of our university , his time is extraordinarily precious * much more precious than mine * but he has granted Kate an interview. A real coup , she tells me. Damn her extracurricular activities . Kate is huddled on the couch in the living room . * Ana , I * m sorry. It took me nine months to get this interview. It will take another six to reschedule , and we * ll both have graduated by then. As the editor , I can * t blow this off. Please , * Kate begs me in her rasping , sore throat voice. How does she do it ? Even ill she looks gamine and gorgeous , strawberry blond hair in place and green eyes bright , although now red rimmed and runny. I ignore my pang of unwelcome sympathy . * Of course I * ll go , Kate. You should get back to bed. Would you like some NyQuil or Tylenol ? * * NyQuil , please. Here are the questions and my digital recorder. Just press record here. Make notes , I * ll transcribe it all. * * I know nothing about him , * I murmur , trying and failing to suppress my rising panic . * The questions will see you through. Go. It * s a long drive. I don * t want you to be late. * * Okay , I * m going. Get back to bed. I"	no
fifty_500_144	"I voluntarily go for a run. I find my nasty , never-used sneakers , some sweatpants , and a T-shirt. I put my hair in pigtails , blushing at the memories they bring back , and I plug in my iPod. I can * t sit in front of that marvel of technology and look at or read any more disturbing material. I need to expend some of this excess , enervating energy. Quite frankly , I have a mind to run to the Heathman Hotel and just demand sex from the control freak. But that * s five miles , and I don * t think I * ll be able to run one mile , let alone five , and , of course , he might turn me down , which would be beyond humiliating . Kate is walking from her car as I head out of the door. She nearly drops her shopping bags when she sees me. Ana Steele in sneakers. I wave and don * t stop for the inquisition. I need some serious alone time. Snow Patrol blaring in my ears , I set off into the opal and aquamarine dusk . I pace through the park. What am I going to do ? I want him , but on his terms ? I just don * t know. Perhaps I should negotiate what I want. Go through that ridiculous contract line by line and say what is acceptable and what isn * t. My research has told me that legally it * s unenforceable. He must know that. I figure that it just sets up the parameters of the relationship. It illustrates what I can expect from him and what he expects from me * my total submission. Am I prepared to give him that ? Am I even capable ? I am plagued by one question * why is he like this ? Is it because he was seduced at such a young age ? I just don * t know. He * s still such a mystery . I stop beside a large spruce and put my hands on my knees , breathing hard , dragging precious air into my lungs. Oh , this feels good , cathartic. I feel my resolve hardening. Yes. I need to tell him what * s okay and what isn * t. I need to e-mail him my thoughts , and then we can discuss these on Wednesday. I take a deep , cleansing breath , then jog back to the apartment . Kate has been shopping , as only she can , for clothes for her vacation to Barbados. Mainly bikinis and matching sarongs. She will look fabulous in all of them , yet she still makes me sit and comment while she tries on each and every one. There are only so many ways one can say , * You look fabulous , Kate. * She has a curvy , slim figure to"	no

Other stuff. Nonverbal communication and that * s okay. Well , much more than okay . She grins. * That * ll be the sexing ! If that * s going well , then that * s half the battle , Ana. I * ll grab some Chinese takeout. Are you ready to go ? * * I will be. We don * t have to leave for a couple of hours or so. * * No * I * ll see you in twenty. * She grabs her jacket and leaves , forgetting to close the door. I shut it behind her and head off to my bedroom , mulling over her words . Is Christian afraid of his feelings for me ? Does he even have feelings for me ? He seems very keen , says I * m his * but that * s just part of his I-must-own-and-have-everything-now control freak Dominant self , surely.

I sit and listen to the angelic voices teasing and seducing me . * Can I hear that again ? * * Of course. * Christian pushes a button , and the music is caressing me once more. It * s a gentle , slow , sweet , and sure assault on my aural senses . * You like classical music ? * I ask , hoping for a rare insight into his personal preferences . * My taste is eclectic , Anastasia , everything from Thomas Tallis to the Kings of Leon. It depends on my mood. You ? * * Me , too. Though I don * t know who Thomas Tallis is. * He turns and gazes at me briefly before his eyes are back on the road . * I * ll play it for you sometime.

Tudor , church choral music. * Christian grins at me. * Sounds very esoteric , I know , but it * s also magical. * He presses a button and the Kings of Leon start singing. Hmm * this I know. * Sex on Fire. * How appropriate. The music is interrupted by the sound of a cell phone ringing over the sound system speakers. Christian hits a button on the steering wheel . * Grey , * he snaps. He * s so brusque . * Mr. Grey , it * s Welch here. I have the information you require. * A rasping , disembodied voice comes over the speakers . * Good. E-mail it to me. Anything to add ? * * No , sir. * He presses the button , then the call ceases and the music is back. No good-bye or thanks.

He stares down at me for a moment , measuring my need , then he grabs me suddenly and flips me over. It takes me by surprise , and because my hands are tied , I have to support myself on my elbows.

He collapses on top of me , breathing hard . * How nice was that ? * he asks through his gritted teeth . Oh my . I lie panting and spent on the bed , eyes closed as he slowly pulls out of me. He rises immediately and dresses. When he * s fully clothed , he climbs back on the bed and gently undoes my binding and pulls my T-shirt off. I flex my fingers and rub my wrists , smiling at the woven pattern imprinted on my wrists from the tie. I readjust my bra as he pulls the duvet and quilt over me.

He gazes down at me . * You are one brave young woman , * he whispers. * I am in awe of you. * His words are like some kind of incendiary device ; my blood flames.

How can you tell ? * * Anastasia , your whole body * s just relaxed , * he says dryly . * Well , you just seem to be , um * on the jealous side. * * Yes , I am , * he says darkly. * And you * d do well to remember that. But thank you for asking. We * ll take Charlie Tango. * Oh , the helicopter of course , silly me. More flying * cool ! I grin . * Can I wash you ? * I ask . * I don * t think so , * he murmurs , and he kisses me gently on my neck to take the sting out of his refusal. I pout at the wall as he caresses my back with soap . * Will you ever let me touch you ? * I ask boldly . He stills again , his hand on my behind . * Put your hands on the wall , Anastasia. I * m going to take you again , * he murmurs in my ear as he grabs my hips , and I know that the discussion is over . LATER , WE ARE SEATED at the breakfast bar , dressed in bathrobes , having consumed Mrs. Jones * s rather excellent pasta alle vongole . * More wine ? * Christian asks , gray eyes glowing . * A small glass , please. * The Sancerre is crisp and delicious. Christian pours one for me and one for himself . * How * s the , um * situation that brought you to Seattle ? * I ask tentatively . He frowns. * Out of hand , * he murmurs bitterly. * But nothing for you to worry about , Anastasia. I have plans for you this evening. * * Oh ? * * Yes.

He spanks me twice more , and then he pulls at the small threads attached to the balls and jerks them out of me suddenly. I almost climax * the feeling is out of this world. Moving swiftly , he gently turns me over. I hear rather than see the rip of the foil packet , and then he * s lying beside me. He seizes my hands , hoists them over my head , and eases himself onto me , into me , sliding slowly , filling me where the silver globes have been. I groan loudly . * Oh , baby , * he whispers as he moves back , forward , a slow sensual tempo , savoring me , feeling me . It is the most gentle he has ever been , and it takes no time at all for me to fall over the edge , spiraling into a delicious , violent , exhausting orgasm. As I clench around him , it ignites his release , and he slides into me , stilling , gasping out my name in desperate wonder . * Ana ! * He * s silent and panting on top of me , his hands still entwined in mine above my head. Finally , he leans back and stares down at me . * I enjoyed that , * he whispers , and then kisses me sweetly .

He sits beside me on the bed . * Roll over , * he orders , and begrudgingly I move onto my front . Honestly , all this fuss.

He reaches up and gently strokes my back . * You have such beautiful skin , Anastasia , * he breathes as he bends down and kisses me along my spine , gentle featherlight kisses. At the same time , his hands move around to my front , palming my breasts , and as he does this he traps my nipples between his fingers and tugs them gently . I stifle my moan as I feel my whole body respond , coming alive once more for him . He gently bites and sucks me at my waist , tugging my nipples , and my hands tighten on the exquisitely carved post. His hands drop away , and I hear the now familiar tear of foil , and he kicks off his jeans . * You have such a captivating , sexy ass , Anastasia Steele. What I * d like to do to it. * His hands smooth and shape each of my buttocks , then his fingers glide down , and he slips two fingers inside me . * So wet. You never disappoint , Miss Steele , * he whispers , and I hear the wonder in his voice. * Hold tight * this is going to be quick , baby. * He grabs my hips and positions himself , and I brace myself for his assault.

He eases out of me slowly , and his other hand grabs my hip , holding tight , and then he slams into me , jolting me forward . * Hold on , Anastasia ! * he shouts through clenched teeth . I grip the post harder and push back against him as he continues his merciless onslaught , again and again , his fingers digging into my hip.

I * m truly perplexed as to what makes someone so driven to succeed. Some of his answers were so cryptic * as if he had a hidden agenda. And Kate * s questions * ugh ! The adoption and asking him if he was gay ! I shudder. I can * t believe I said that. Ground , swallow me up now ! Every time I think of that question in the future , I will cringe with embarrassment. Damn Katherine Kavanagh ! I check the speedometer. I * m driving more cautiously than I would on any other occasion. And I know it * s the memory of those penetrating gray eyes gazing at me and a stern voice telling me to drive carefully. Shaking my head , I realize that Grey * s more like a man twice his age . Forget it , Ana , I scold myself. I decide that , all in all , it * s been a very interesting experience , but I shouldn * t dwell on it. Put it behind you. I never have to see him again. I * m immediately cheered by the thought. I switch on the stereo and turn the volume up loud , sit back and listen to thumping indie rock music as I press down on the accelerator. As I hit Interstate 5 , I realize I can drive as fast as I want . WE LIVE IN A small community of duplex apartments close to the Vancouver campus of WSU. I * m lucky * Kate * s parents bought the place for her , and I pay peanuts for rent. It * s been home for four years now.

I hope I won * t have to elaborate much beyond what was said during the interview . * Ana ! You * re back. * Kate sits in our living area , surrounded by books. She * s clearly been studying for finals * she * s still in her pink flannel pajamas decorated with cute little rabbits , the ones she reserves for the aftermath of breaking up with boyfriends , for assorted illnesses , and for general moody depression. She bounds up to me and hugs me hard . * I was beginning to worry.

His eyes soften as I gaze up at him . * Stand up , * he orders . I climb warily to my feet. He stares at me and his mouth quirks up . * You * re shattered , aren * t you ? * I nod shyly , flushing . * Stamina , Miss Steele. * He narrows his eyes at me. * I haven * t had my fill of you yet. Hold out your hands in front as if you * re praying. * I blink at him. Praying ! Praying for you to go easy on me. I do as I * m told. He takes a cable tie and fastens it around my wrists , tightening the plastic. Holy hell. My eyes fly to his . * Look familiar ? * he asks , unable to conceal his smile . Jeez * the plastic cable ties. Restocking at Clayton * s ! It all becomes clear. I gape up at him as adrenaline spikes though my body anew. Okay * that * s got my attention * I * m awake now . * I have scissors here. * He holds them up for me to see. * I can cut you out of this in a moment. * I try to pull my wrists apart , testing my bonds , and as I do , the plastic bites into my flesh.

I notice now that it has dark red sheets on it and a shackle at each corner . He leans down and whispers in my ear , * I want more * much , much more. * And my heartbeat starts pounding again. Oh boy . * But I * ll make this quick. You * re tired. Hold on to the post , * he says . I frown. Not on the bed then ? I find I can part my hands as I grasp the ornately carved wooden post . * Lower , * he orders. * Good. Don * t let go. If you do , I * ll spank you. Understand ? * * Yes , Sir. * * Good. * He stands behind me and grasps my hips , and then quickly lifts me backward so I * m bending forward , holding the post . * Don * t let go , Anastasia , * he warns. * I * m going to fuck you hard from behind.

fifty_500_237	"for that ? * * Yes , * I breathe as everything in my body tightens at once * wow . * Good. Come. * He takes my hand and , leaving all the dirty dishes on the breakfast bar , we head upstairs . My heart starts pounding. This is it. I * m really going to do this. My inner goddess is spinning like a world-class ballerina , pirouette after pirouette. He opens the door to his playroom , standing back for me to walk through , and I am once more in the Red Room of Pain . It * s the same , the smell of leather , citrus-scented polish , and dark wood , all very sensual. My blood is running heated and scared through my system * adrenaline mixed with lust and longing. It * s a heady , potent cocktail. Christian * s stance has changed completely , subtly altered , harder and meaner. He gazes down at me and his eyes are heated , lustful * hypnotic . * When you * re in here , you are completely mine , * he breathes , each word slow and measured. * To do with as I see fit. Do you understand ? * His gaze is so intense. I nod , my mouth dry , my heart feeling as if it will jump out of my chest . * Take your shoes off , * he orders softly . I swallow , and rather clumsily , I take them off. He bends and picks them up and deposits them beside the door . * Good. Don * t hesitate when I ask you to do something. Now I * m going to peel you out of this dress. Something I * ve wanted to do for a few days , if I recall. I want you to be comfortable with your body , Anastasia. You have a beautiful body , and I like to look at it. It is a joy to behold. In fact , I could gaze at you all day , and I want you unembarrassed and unashamed of your nakedness. Do you understand ? * * Yes. * * Yes , what ? * He leans over me , glaring . * Yes , Sir. * * Do you mean that ? * he snaps . * Yes , Sir. * * Good. Lift your arms up over your head. * I do as instructed , and he reaches down and grabs the hem. Slowly , he pulls my dress up over my thighs , my hips , my belly , my breasts , my shoulders , and up over my head. He stands back to examine me and absentmindedly folds my dress , not taking his eyes off me. He places it on the large chest beside the door. Reaching up , he pulls at my chin , his touch searing me . * You * re"	yes

His cool fingers trail languidly across my belly. My skin is oversensitive , my hips flex automatically , and the now-warmer liquid from my navel seeps over my belly. Christian moves quickly , lapping it up with his tongue , kissing , biting me softly , sucking . * Oh dear , Anastasia , you moved. What am I going to do to you ? * I * m panting loudly. All I can concentrate on is his voice and his touch. Nothing else is real. Nothing else matters , nothing else registers on my radar. His fingers slip into my panties , and I * m rewarded with his unguarded sharp intake of air . * Oh , baby , * he murmurs , and he pushes two fingers inside me . I gasp . * Ready for me so soon , * he says. He moves his fingers tantalizingly slowly , in , out , and I push against him , tilting my hips up . * You are a greedy girl , * he scolds softly , and his thumb circles my clitoris and then presses down . I groan loudly as my body bucks beneath his expert fingers. He reaches up and pushes the T-shirt over my head so I can see him. I blink in the soft light of my sidelight. I long to touch him . * I want to touch you , * I breathe . * I know , * he murmurs. He leans down and kisses me , his fingers still moving rhythmically inside me , his thumb circling and pressing. His other hand scoops my hair off my head and holds my head in place. His tongue mirrors the actions of his fingers , claiming me. My legs begin to stiffen as I push against his hand. He gentles his hand , so I * m brought back from the brink. He does this again and again. It * s so frustrating * Oh , please , Christian , I scream in my head . * This is your punishment , so close and yet so far. Is this nice ? * he breathes in my ear. I whimper , exhausted , pulling against my restraint. I * m helpless , lost in an erotic torment . * Please , * I beg , and he finally takes pity on me . * How shall I fuck you , Anastasia ? * Oh * my body starts to quiver.

It * s been one long day , one emotional wrench after another. It was heartwarming to spend some time with Ray. He looked well , and weirdly , he approved of Christian. Jeez , Kate and her gargantuan mouth. Hearing Christian speak about being hungry. What the hell is that all about ? God , and the car. I haven * t even told Kate about the new car. What was Christian thinking ? And then this evening , he actually hit me. I * ve never been hit in my life. What have I gotten myself into ?

I flush , chastened , and stare down at my fingers , and I know , I know that someone stubbed cigarettes out on Christian. I feel sick . * Did she do that ? * I whisper before I can stop myself . He says nothing , so I * m forced to look at him. He * s glaring at me . * She ? Mrs. Robinson ? She * s not an animal , Anastasia. Of course she didn * t.

Again the silence stretches between us , but I hold my counsel. It * s your turn , Grey * I am not caving this time.

He runs his fingers down my pigtails . * You look so young with these , * he murmurs , and moves forward. Instinctively , I move back until I feel the bed against the back of my knees.

The idea is preposterous , and I kick it out of my head . * Are you in Portland on business ? * I ask , and my voice is too high , like I * ve got my finger trapped in a door or something. Damn !

For * oh * what * s happening ? What * s he going to do now ? The excitement is almost unbearable. I * ve entered a very dark , carnal place .

Of course I would , if he asked me * as long as he didn * t hurt me and if it * s the only way to be with him . That * s the bottom line. I want to be with him. My inner goddess sighs with relief. I reach the conclusion that she rarely uses her brain to think but another vital part of her anatomy , and at the moment , it * s a rather exposed part . * Don * t , * he murmurs .

It * s almost embarrassing to witness.

Humor has returned to his voice. Oh , thank heavens. When I nod , he pats my back gently and only removes his hand when he knows I * ve recovered . The beef is delicious and served with roasted sweet potatoes , carrots , parsnips , and green beans. It is even more palatable since Christian manages to retain his good humor for the rest of the meal. I suspect that it * s because I * m eating so heartily. The conversation flows freely among the Greys , warm and caring , gently teasing one another. Over our dessert of lemon syllabub , Mia regales us with her exploits in Paris , lapsing at one point into fluent French.

It offers me a rare opportunity to talk about the impressive work of the environmental science department here at the university. Our aim is to develop viable and ecologically sustainable methods of farming for third world countries ; our ultimate goal is to help eradicate hunger and poverty across the globe. Over a billion people , mainly in sub-Saharan Africa , South Asia , and Latin America , live in abject poverty. Agricultural dysfunction is rife within these parts of the world , and the result is ecological and social destruction. I have known what it * s like to be profoundly hungry.

It * s a big day. * And I * m going to see him . * Yeah , my baby girl has gotten a degree. I * m proud of you , Annie. * * Aw * thanks , Dad. * Oh , I love this man . The gym is crowded.

Last on to the stage are Kate and Christian. Christian stands out in his bespoke gray suit , copper highlights glinting in his hair under the auditorium lights. He looks so serious and self-contained. As he sits , he undoes his single-breasted jacket , and I glimpse his tie. Holy shit * that tie ! I rub my wrists reflexively. I can not take my eyes off him.

I pretend to read the article , all the time meeting his steady gray gaze , searching the photo for some clue as to why he * s not the man for me * his own words to me.

A young man in full Heathman livery approaches us . * Mr. Grey , this way , sir. * We follow him through a plush seating area to an intimate dining room. Just one secluded table. The room is small but sumptuous. Beneath a shimmering chandelier , the table is all starched linen , crystal glasses , silver cutlery , and white rose bouquet.

Once underneath the dark , cold concrete of the garage with its bleak fluorescent light , I lean against the wall and put my head in my hands. What was I thinking ?

I am going to have to process all this. Honestly , fancy falling for a man who * s beyond beautiful , richer than Croesus , and has a Red Room of Pain waiting for me. I shudder. I * m bewildered and confused. My hair is its usual wayward self. Just-fucked hair doesn * t suit me. I try to bring order to the chaos with my fingers but fail miserably and give up * maybe I * ll find hair ties in my purse . I * m starving. I head back out to the bedroom. Sleeping beauty is still sleeping , so I leave him and head for the kitchen . Oh no * Kate. I left my purse in Christian * s study. I fetch it and reach for my cell phone. Three texts . * RU OK Ana * * Where RU Ana * * Damn it Ana * I call Kate. When she doesn * t answer , I leave her a groveling message to tell her I am alive and have not succumbed to Bluebeard , well , not in the sense she would be worried about * or perhaps I have. Oh , this is so confusing. I have to try to categorize and analyze my feelings for Christian Grey. It * s an impossible task. I shake my head in defeat. I need alone time , away from here to think . I find two welcome hair ties at the same time in my bag and quickly tie my hair in pigtails. Yes ! The more girly I look perhaps the safer I * ll be from Bluebeard. I take my iPod out of the bag and plug my headphones in. There * s nothing like music to cook by. I slip it into the breast pocket of Christian * s shirt , turn it up loud , and start dancing . Holy hell , I * m hungry . I am daunted by his kitchen. It * s so sleek and modern , and none of the cupboards has handles. It takes me a few seconds to deduce that I have to push the cupboard doors to open them. Perhaps I should cook Christian breakfast. He was eating an omelet the other day * um , yesterday at the Heathman. Jeez , so much has happened since then.

Quickly , I rip a small piece of paper from my notebook , hastily scribble a note for him , and leave it on top of the box . This reminded me of a happy time . Thank you . Ana I gaze at myself in the mirror. A pale and haunted ghost stares back at me. I scoop my hair into a bun and ignore how swollen my eyelids are from the crying. My subconscious nods with approval. Even she knows not to be snarky right now. I can not believe that my world is crumbling around me into a sterile pile of ashes , all my hopes and dreams cruelly dashed. No , no , don * t think about it. Not now , not yet. Taking a deep breath , I pick up my case , and after placing the glider kit and my note on his pillow , I head for the great room . Christian is on the phone. He * s dressed in black jeans and a T-shirt. His feet are bare . * He said what ? * he shouts , making me jump. * Well , he could have told us the fucking truth. What * s his number ? I need to call him * Welch , this is a real fuckup. * He glances up and doesn * t take his dark and brooding eyes off me. * Find her , * he snaps and presses the off switch . I walk over to the couch and collect my backpack , doing my best to ignore him. I take the Mac out of it and walk back toward the kitchen , placing it carefully on the breakfast bar , along with the BlackBerry and the car key. When I turn to face him , he * s staring at me , stupefied with horror . * I need the money that Taylor got for my Beetle. * My voice is clear and calm , devoid of emotion * extraordinary . * Ana , I don * t want those things , they * re yours , * he says in disbelief. * Take them. * * No , Christian. I only accepted them under sufferance * and I don * t want them anymore. * * Ana , be reasonable , * he scolds me , even now . * I don * t want anything that will remind me of you. I just need the money that Taylor got for my car. * My voice is quite monotone . He gasps. * Are you really trying to wound me ? * * No. * I frown , staring at him.

His brow furrows , his eyes widening. He blinks twice . * I don * t want you to spank me , not here , not now. Please don * t. * His mouth drops open in surprise , and beyond brave , I tentatively reach up and run my fingers down his cheek , along the edge of his sideburn , to the stubble on his chin. It * s a curious mixture of soft and prickly. Slowly closing his eyes , he leans his face into my touch , and his breath hitches in his throat. Reaching up with my other hand , I run my fingers into his hair. I love his hair. His soft moan is barely audible , and when he opens his eyes , his look is wary , like he doesn * t understand what I * m doing . Stepping forward so I am flush against him , I pull gently on his hair , bringing his mouth down to mine , and I kiss him , forcing my tongue between his lips and into his mouth. He groans , and his arms embrace me , pulling me to him. His hands find their way into my hair , and he kisses me back , hard and possessive. His tongue and my tongue twist and turn together , consuming each other. He tastes divine . He pulls back suddenly , our collective breathing ragged and mingling. My hands drop to his arms , and he glares down at me . * What are you doing to me ? * he whispers , confused . * Kissing you. * * You said no. * * What ? * No to what ? * At the dinner table , with your legs. * Oh * that * s what this is all about . * But we were at your parents * dining table. * I stare up at him , completely bewildered . * No one * s ever said no to me before. And it * s so * hot. * His eyes widen , filled with wonder and lust. It * s a heady mix. I swallow instinctively. His hand moves down to my behind. He pulls me sharply against him , against his erection . Oh my * * You * re mad and turned on because I said no ? * I breathe , astonished . * I * m mad because you never mentioned Georgia to me.

European Pigtails is nowhere to be seen . * I * m going to show Anastasia the backyard , * Christian says innocently to his mother.

I * m leaning against his chest , my eyes are closed , and he * s wrapped around me * arms and legs * and I feel * safe , and oh so comfortable. Will he let me sleep , perchance to dream ?

I open my eyes and glance up at him. He * s staring down at me . * Don * t , * he breathes in warning . I flush and look back at his chest in longing. I want to run my tongue through the hair , kiss him , and for the first time , I notice he has a few random and faint small , round scars dotted around his chest. Chicken pox ? Measles ? I think absently . * Kneel by the door , * he orders as he sits back , putting his hands on his knees , effectively releasing me. No longer warm , the temperature of his voice has dropped several degrees . I stumble clumsily up into a standing position and scoot over to the door and kneel as instructed. I * m shaky and very , very tired , monumentally confused. Who would have thought I could have found such gratification in this room. Who could have thought it would be so exhausting ? My limbs are deliciously heavy , sated. My inner goddess has a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the outside of her room . Christian is moving about in the periphery of my vision.

Outside , in the relative cool of the half light of predawn , the valet hands Christian a set of keys to a flashy sports car with a soft top. I raise an eyebrow at Christian , who smirks back at me . * You know , sometimes it * s great being me , * he says with a conspiratorial but smug grin that I simply can * t help emulating.

He is in such a good mood . * Where are we going ? * * You * ll see. * He grins as he slips the car into drive , and we head out on Savannah Parkway. He programs the GPS and presses a switch on the steering wheel , and a classical orchestral piece fills the car . * What * s this ? * I ask as the sweet , sweet sound of a hundred violin strings assails us . * It * s from La Traviata. An opera by Verdi. * Oh , my * it * s lovely . * La Traviata ? I * ve heard of that. I can * t think where.

He taps the screen on the console between us , and behold * there is a playlist . * You choose. * His lips twitch up into a smile , and I know it * s a challenge .

From them swing a startling assortment of paddles , whips , riding crops , and funny-looking feathery implements . Beside the door stands a substantial mahogany chest of drawers , each drawer slim as if designed to contain specimens in a crusty old museum. I wonder briefly what the drawers actually do hold. Do I want to know ? In the far corner is an oxblood leather padded bench , and fixed to the wall beside it is a wooden , polished rack that looks like a pool or billiard cue holder , but on closer inspection , it holds canes of varying lengths and widths. There * s a stout six-foot-long table in the opposite corner * polished wood with intricately carved legs * and two matching stools underneath . But what dominates the room is a bed. It * s bigger than king sized , an ornately carved rococo four-poster with a flat top. It looks late nineteenth century. Under the canopy , I can see more gleaming chains and cuffs. There is no bedding * just a mattress covered in red leather and red satin cushions piled at one end . At the foot of the bed , set apart a few feet , is a large oxblood chesterfield couch , just stuck in the middle of the room facing the bed.

Leaning against one of the steel pillars of the building , I valiantly attempt to calm down and gather my thoughts. I shake my head. What was that ? My heart steadies to its regular rhythm , and when I can breathe normally again I head for the car . AS I LEAVE THE city limits behind , I begin to feel foolish and embarrassed as I replay the interview in my mind. Surely I * m overreacting to something that * s imaginary. Okay , so he * s very attractive , confident , commanding , at ease with himself * but on the flip side , he * s arrogant , and for all his impeccable manners , he * s autocratic and cold.

Christian wraps his arm around my waist , pulling me tightly against him . * Come , * he shouts above the noise of the wind. He drags me over to an elevator and , after tapping a number into a keypad , the doors open. It * s warm inside and all mirrored glass. I can see Christian to infinity everywhere I look , and the wonderful thing is he * s holding me to infinity , too. Christian taps another code into the keypad , then the doors close and the elevator descends . Moments later , we * re in an all-white foyer. In the middle is a round , dark wood table , and on it is an unbelievably huge bunch of white flowers. On the walls there are paintings everywhere. He opens a set of double doors , and the white theme continues across a wide corridor where directly opposite , is the entrance to a palatial room. It * s the main living area , double height. * Huge * is too small a word for it. The far wall is glass and leads onto a balcony that overlooks Seattle . To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat ten adults comfortably. It faces a state-of-the-art stainless-steel * or maybe platinum , for all I know * modern fireplace. The fire is lit and flaming gently. On the left beside us , by the entry way , is the kitchen area. All white with dark wood worktops and a breakfast bar that seats six . Near the kitchen area , in front of the glass wall , is a dining table surrounded by sixteen chairs. And tucked in the corner is a full-sized , shiny black grand piano. Oh yes * he probably plays the piano , too. There is art of all shapes and sizes on all the walls. In fact , this apartment looks more like a gallery than a place to live . * Can I take your jacket ? * Christian asks. I shake my head. I * m still cold from the wind on the helipad . * Would you like a drink ? * he asks. I blink at him. After last night ! Is he trying to be funny ?

After a brief conversation with Taylor , Christian clambers into the car beside me. He turns to face me . * Well , it seems my family likes you , too , * he murmurs . Too ? The depressing thought about how I came to be invited pops unbidden and very unwelcome into my head. Taylor starts the car and heads away from the circle of light in the driveway to the darkness of the road. I gaze at Christian , and he * s staring at me . * What ? * he asks , his voice quiet .

So one will have to do. * His voice is low , soft . His deft fingers skim my back occasionally as they work down my hair , and each casual touch is like a sweet , electric shock against my skin. He fastens the end with a hair tie , then gently tugs the braid so that I * m forced to step back flush against him. He pulls again to the side so that I angle my head , giving him easier access to my neck. Leaning down , he nuzzles my neck , tracing his teeth and tongue from the base of my ear to my shoulder.

Your e-mail for example : I have read and reread it countless times trying to understand your point of view. Three months is an arbitrary amount of time. We could make it six months , a year ? How long do you want it to be ? What would make you comfortable ? Tell me . I understand that this is a huge leap of faith for you.

He briefly closes his eyes and , on opening them , resumes his indifferent expression.

The chancellor sits , and Kate tosses her lovely long hair behind her as she places her papers on the lectern. She takes her time , not intimidated by a thousand people staring at her. She smiles when she * s ready , looks up at the captivated throng , and launches eloquently into her speech. She * s composed and funny , the girls beside me erupt on cue at her first joke.

The elevator whisks me at terminal velocity to the twentieth floor. The doors slide open , and I * m in another large lobby * again all glass , steel , and white sandstone. I * m confronted by another desk of sandstone and another young blonde woman , this time dressed impeccably in black and white , who rises to greet me . * Miss Steele , could you wait here , please ? * She points to a seated area of white leather chairs . Behind the leather chairs is a spacious glass-walled meeting room with an equally spacious dark wood table and at least twenty matching chairs around it. Beyond that , there is a floor-to-ceiling window with a view of the Seattle skyline that looks out through the city toward the Sound. It * s a stunning vista , and I * m momentarily paralyzed by the view. Wow . I sit down , fish the questions from my backpack , and go through them , inwardly cursing Kate for not providing me with a brief biography. I know nothing about this man I * m about to interview. He could be ninety or he could be thirty. The uncertainty is galling , and my nerves resurface , making me fidget. I * ve never been comfortable with one-on-one interviews , preferring the anonymity of a group discussion where I can sit inconspicuously at the back of the room. To be honest , I prefer my own company , reading a classic British novel , curled up in a chair in the campus library. Not sitting twitching nervously in a colossal glass-and-stone edifice . I roll my eyes at myself. Get a grip , Steele. Judging from the building , which is too clinical and modern , I guess Grey is in his forties : fit , tanned , and fair-haired to match the rest of the personnel . Another elegant , flawlessly dressed blonde comes out of a large door to the right. What is it with all the immaculate blondes ? It * s like Stepford here. Taking a deep breath , I stand up . * Miss Steele ? * the latest blonde asks . * Yes , * I croak , and clear my throat. * Yes. * There , that sounded more confident . * Mr. Grey will see you in a moment.

I ignore her and make my way upstairs toward my room. So , it is still mine * why ? I thought he * d agreed to let me sleep with him. I suppose he * s not used to sharing his personal space , but then , neither am I. I console myself with the thought that at least I have somewhere to escape from him .
